# My First Portfolio Page

This project is an assignment for my Software Engineering bootcamp with Thinkful. We were tasked with using the HTML and CSS skills that we have learned to date to create a portfolio page. The page contains:

1. Header: Includes my name and headshot
2. Introduction: Who I am and where I'm located
3. About Me: A description about my passion realted to web development and my interests outside of work
4. Contact: A link to my LinkedIn and Github profiles

I appreciate any feedback and come back to check out my new projects - as they are created! :)
