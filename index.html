        <p class="wrapper-body">Hello! My name is Kevin Duque and I'm currently a Senior Product Manager for Bynder working remotely from Houston, TX. Prior to my role at Bynder, I held various roles at Baker Hughes (formerely GE Oil & Gas) and was a financial analyst for a venture capital firm outside of Boston. By trade, I have a Bachelors in Finance and my MBA. If I were to describe my strengths in three words, here they are:</p>

        <h2 class="wrapper">About Me</h2>
        <p class="wrapper-body">During my time at Baker Hughes, I was immeresed in product development right from the start. I took a role where I needed to lead the execution of rebranding the former "Baker Hughes, a GE company" website and launch it on a new Drupal CMS. I had no prior web experience at the time and had to learn quick on the job. From here, I fell in love with the web, UX, visual design, and engineering. I could see myself in any of these roles throughout my careers. The one I felt most curious about though, was engineering!</p>

        <p class="wrapper-body">Engineering reminds me a ton of music production. You build many layers to a song just like you build layers to an application, you have sounds work in sync with eachother just like you create functions in Javascript to contribute to a task; its all sort of similar. Buts that cool part, you get to build from scratch and work with others to solve challenging problems. Here are the top things I like to do outside of work as my creative outlet that fuels my interest in wanting to be an engineer:</p>

          <li>Binging the latest top show</li>
